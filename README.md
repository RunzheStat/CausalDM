# CausalDM
**CausalDM** is Python package for evaluating and learning decision-making policies from observational or experiment data, under the causal inference framework. 
This package accompanies [Causal Decision Making](http://causaldm.com/), an online tutorial with the goal of providing practitioners a systematic review, map, and handbook for finding the appropriate solutions for their problems. 
The overall objective is to reduce the gap from academic research to real-world applications of causal inference and optimal decision making.
